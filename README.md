## The FizzBuzz challenge.

FizzBuzz is originally a child's game that taught them division. The way FizzBuzz works is you check if a number can be divided on 3, and if so, you say Fizz, and if the number can be divided on 5, you say Buzz. If it can be divided by both 3 and 5, you say FizzBuzz, and if cannot be divided by either, you just say the number.

Create a program that let's the user input 2 numbers. Then the program will output a list where it counts from the smaller number to the larger number and checks if it is possible to divide by 3 (output Fizz), 5 (output Buzz), both (output FizzBuzz) and none (output number).

### Example 1
```
Input number 1: 3
Input number 2: 8
Output: Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8
```
### Example 2
``````
Input number 1: 16
Input number 2: 12
Output: Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16
